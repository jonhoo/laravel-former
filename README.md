# Former
Former is a form library for Laravel that provides HTML5 form field types,
validation and various other convenient luxuries for modern app development.

## Installing

- Install [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) and place the executable somewhere
  in your `$PATH` (for the rest of this README, I'll reference it as just
  `composer`)

- Add `jonhoo/former` to your project's `composer.json:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "jonhoo/former": "0.*"
    }
}
```

- Install/update your dependencies

```bash
$ cd my_project
$ composer install
```
